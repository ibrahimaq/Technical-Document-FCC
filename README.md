# Technical-Document-FCC
This is part of FreeCodeCamp's web design module.

## General
This technical document page is given a simple design while maximising reading space. 
I have tried to mimic paper-like eye-friendly colour so reader is at comfort.
Although technical documents are designed for desktops I have implemented mobile responsive features - navigation menu sits at the top of the page.

## Things to improve
In mobile-view I feel the navigation menu should have a toggle so it can be accessed only when needed. This avoids the 
necessity to scroll to the top of the body in order to navigate.
