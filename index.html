          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style
          and lay out web pages — for example, to alter 
          the font, color, size, and spacing of your 
          content, split it into multiple columns, or add
          animations and other decorative features. This 
          document provides a gentle beginning to your path
          towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it 
          works, what the syntax looks like, and how you
          can start using it to add styling to HTML.

        <p>Before starting this module, you should have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Basic familiarity with using computers, and using the Web
              passively (i.e.looking at it, consuming the content.)
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction
              to HTML module.
            </li>

          CSS is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser. The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.

CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.

A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background:</p>
        
        <code>
          /* The selector "p" indicate that all paragraphs in the document will be affected by that rule */
p {
  /* The "color" property defines the text color, in this case yellow. */
  color: yellow;

  /* The "background-color" property defines the background color, in this case black. */
  background-color: black
}
        </code>

         <p>When a browser displays a document, it must
           combine the document's content with its style
           information. It processes the document in a
           number of stages, which we've listed below.
           Bear in mind that this is a very simplified
           version of what happens when a browser loads
           a webpage, and that different browsers will
           handle the process in different ways. But
           this is roughly what happens.
         </p>
         
         <ol>
           <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives
                it from the network).
           </li>
           <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document
             Object Model). The DOM represents the document
             in the computer's memory. The DOM is explained
             in a bit more detail in the next section.
           </li>
           <li>The browser then fetches most of the
             resources that are linked to by the HTML
             document, such as embedded images and videos
             ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a
             bit later on in the process, and we won't talk
             about it here to keep things simpler
           </li>
           <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts
             the different rules by their selector types
             into different "buckets", e.g. element, class,
             ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds,
             it works out which rules should be applied to
             which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to
             them as required (this intermediate step is
             called a render tree).
           </li>
           <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure
             it should appear in after the rules have been
             applied to it.
           </li>
           <li>The visual display of the page is shown on
             the screen (this stage is called painting).
           </li>
         </ol>

  <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
    <header>Syntax</header>  
      <article>
        <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you
          define rules specifying groups of
          styles that should be applied to 
          particular elements or groups of 
          elements on your web page. For example 
          "I want the main heading on my page to 
          be shown as large red text.
        <br><br>

          The following code shows a very simple 
          CSS rule that would achieve the styling 
          described above:
        </p>
        
        <code>h1 {
          color: red;
          font-size: 5em;
          }
        </code>
       <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The rule opens with a selector . This selects
          the HTML element that we are going to style. In
          this case we are styling level one headings &lth1&gt.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more
          declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a
          property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the
          property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS
          properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being
          specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color
          values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size
          units as a value.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.
        </p>
        <code>
            h1 {
          color: red;
          font-size: 5em;
            }
          p {
          color: black;
           }
        </code>
        
       <p>
          You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to 
          look up.

        <h3>CSS Element Selector</h3>
        <p>
          The element selector selects HTML elements based on the
          element name.
        </p>
        <p>Here, all &ltp&gt elements on the page will be
          center-aligned, with a red text color: 
        </p>
        
        <code>p {
              text-align: center;
              color: red;
              }
        </code>
        
        <h3>CSS id Selector</h3>
        
        <p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element
          to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique
          within a page, so the id selector is used to select one
          unique element! To select an element with a specific id,
          write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the
          element.
        </p>
        <p>The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with            id="para1":
        </p>
        <code>#para1 {
              text-align: center;
            color: red;
              }
        </code>
        
        <h3>CSS class Selector</h3>
        <p>The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific
          class attribute.
          To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.)
          character, followed by the class name.
        </p>
        <p>In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will
          be red and center-aligned:
        </p>
        <code>.center {
              text-align: center;
              color: red;
              }
        </code>
        
        <h3>CSS Universal Selector</h3>
        <p>The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements
            on the page.
        </p>
        <p>The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element 
            on the page:
        </p>
        <code>* {
              text-align: center;
              color: blue;
              }
        </code>

            multiple HTML elements and other efficient ways of styling by
